# 👋 Hello, I'm Abdellah Elmrabet (0xpekenbower)

A passionate IT professional with a strong background in low-level programming, using C and C++. I don't have any specific field of interest; I'm always eager to learn new things and explore new technologies.

## 📚 **What I'm Studying**

- I’m currently a student at 1337 School (one of the schools in the 42 network).
- I'm actually at the end of the common core, so there are 4 projects (Inception, CPP Pool, FT_IRC, and FT_Transcendence).
- This is about my formal education, but I'm always learning new things and exploring new technologies.

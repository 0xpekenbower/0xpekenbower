# 👋 Hello, I'm Abdellah Elmrabet (aka 0xpekenbower)

I’m a DevOps engineer and systems enthusiast with a strong foundation in low-level programming (C/C++) and a deep interest in automation, observability, and infrastructure.

Currently a student at **1337 School** (part of the 42 Network), I'm completing the **Common Core curriculum**, where I built solid knowledge in system programming, networking, containerization, and software architecture.
